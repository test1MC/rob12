                <p>Information is shared between simPRO and Connect by syncing. This ensures that new or updated jobs, quotes, activities or schedules are reflected in simPRO and Connect for a smooth workflow.</p>
                <p>When connected to the internet, data is first synced from Connect to simPRO. Receiving data from simPRO may take some time depending on the amount of data updated, for example, the catalogue takes more time to update in Connect than a job does.</p>
                <h3><a name="Sync-in-the-background"></a>Sync in the background</h3>
                <p>If you tap <b>Submit</b> on the <b>Submit</b> page of a job or quote in Connect, a background sync with simPRO will begin and you will then be taken back to the runsheet.</p>
                <p>Background syncing makes it easy to progress through a job or quote workflow without having to wait for the syncing process to complete. The background sync only syncs the item being submitted, and does not <MadCap:xref href="#Sync-all-data">Sync all data</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <p>While Connect is performing a background sync, the relevant job or quote will have a spinning icon in the lower right corner.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Other jobs or quotes on the runsheet will be accessible, but the job or quote that is being synced will be greyed out and restricted from access until the sync has finished.</p>
                <p>When the background sync has finished, a confirmation bubble will appear and you will be able to access the job again.</p>

When an internet connection is re-established, you can open the created job according to the date it was last modified offline, tap <b>Submit</b> and the background sync will perform as normal.</p>
                <h3><a name="Sync-all-data"></a>Sync all data</h3>
                <p>As background syncing does not sync all data, it is recommended to sync Connect with simPRO at least once a day to ensure data is up to date.</p>
                <p>To perform a full sync, tap <b>Sync</b> on Connect's dashboard while your device is connected to the internet. The syncing screen will appear and all Connect features will be unavailable until the sync is complete.</p>
