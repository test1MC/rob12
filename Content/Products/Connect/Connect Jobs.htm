        <p>Use Connect to view, create, update, complete and invoice jobs in the field. You can work through jobs created in simPRO, as well as jobs converted from quotes in both simPRO and Connect. See <MadCap:xref href="Connect Quotes.htm#Submit-a-quote" target="_blank">Submit and convert a quote</MadCap:xref> for more information about quotes in Connect.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can <MadCap:xref href="#Create-a-job-in-Connect">Create a job in Connect</MadCap:xref>.</p>

                <p>If you have purchased Maintenance Planner, you can use additional functionalities to help you test and manage assets, such as service levels and failure points and recommendations. You can also assign test readings to specific service levels in Enterprise so that only the necessary test readings will appear in Connect when you perform a particular service.</p>
                <p>To record asset test results:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate to the <b>Assets</b> page of the desired job using the jump menu.</li>
                    <li>Tap the asset you wish to record a result for.</li>
                    <li>Choose an option:<ul><li>Tap <b>Pass</b> if the test was successfully completed.</li><li>Tap <b>No Test</b> if the test was not done or is incomplete. (please ensure you check your industry standards for non-compliance/no test)</li><li>Tap <b>Fail</b> if the asset failed during testing. If you have Maintenance Planner, you can then select <b>Failure Points</b> and <b>Recommendations</b> for rectification of the failure.</li></ul></li>
                    <li>Enter <b>Result Notes</b> as desired.</li>
                    <li>If you have set up test readings for the asset, tap the <b>Test Readings</b> tab to record specific asset data.
