                </p>
                <p>Breadcrumbs are displayed below the main menu on all pages except the dashboard. The right-most label is your current location in the system.</p>
                <p>Click the breadcrumbs to the left to return to previous pages instead of using your browser's back button.</p>
                <h3>Perform a global search</h3>
                <p>Use the global search bar to the right of your simPRO interface in the main menu to search for actions, records, and card files throughout your entire simPRO system.</p>
                <p>To perform a global search, enter key terms, such as the customer or site name, then select from the drop-down list as applicable. The drop-down list displays the first ten results for your search and will only appear if you do not click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
                <p>You can also hover over the <strong>bookmark </strong>icon to view and access your saved searches.</p>

                <p>To perform a global search and view all results, enter the desired search terms, then click <strong>Search</strong>. You can then view results by <strong>Category</strong>, as well as the number of <strong>Results within Category</strong>.</p>

                </p>
                <p>When you click a <strong>Category</strong>, you will be taken to the applicable data table with the results automatically filtered according to the <strong>Advanced </strong>local search filters. You can then save the search by clicking <strong>Save Search</strong>.</p>
