        <h1>simTRAC</h1>
        <p>simTRAC is live vehicle tracking software. Once you have installed GPS trackers into your vehicles, you can monitor your vehicles' movements in real time, watch replays of their past movements, and send messages to drivers. Using simTRAC assists with driver safety, gives more accurate reporting on driver activity, and reduces administration.</p>
        <p>Using simTRAC is as easy as using Google maps, and the maps are as current as those available on Google.</p>
