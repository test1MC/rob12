        <h1>Pre-Implementation Accounting Requirements</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In preparation for the day of Implementation below we’ve listed some requirements to consider and / or action before the day. As always, please call or email us with any questions.</p>
        <h2>Data integrity checklist</h2>
        <p>This is the perfect time for a spring clean. Spend time with your existing system and make sure you’re going to be happy with the data you're bringing across.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove duplicate customers &amp; sites.</li>
            <li>Archive or disable obsolete records. These may include customers, and / or site records and files.</li>
            <li>Make sure all customer and site data you’d like imported to simPRO Enterprise exists in your accounting system.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Chart of Accounts</h2>
        <p>We’ll require your Chart of Accounts to ensure the Accounting Link is pushing the financial transactions to the appropriate accounts. On the day we can discuss this further. It will ultimately be your decision, ideally in consultation with your accountant.</p>
        <h2>Non-accounting data</h2>
        <p>Data extraction from other systems or data modification is the responsibility of the client. Once all required data is extracted the Implementation consultant will check it is in the appropriate format. Another option is to engage an external consultant such as: <a href="http://convertworx.com.au/">convertworx.com.au</a></p>
        <h2>Linking your accounting package to simPRO Enterprise</h2>
        <p>On day one of Implementation, the Accounting Link will be installed and configured on whichever PC has direct access to the executable file and the data files of your accounting software. Ensure you have administrator access to the PC and / or the server hosting the simPRO Accounting link.</p>
        <p>We strongly recommend the person responsible for your accounting is present on the first day.</p>
        <p>If you’re unsure about your accounting software’s compatibility with simPRO Enterprise, contact us as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>All we require here is the Administrator login details. MYOB Live, Xero and Quickbooks Online are completely compatible with the simPRO Accounting Link.</p>
                        <h3>MYOB AccountRight Live</h3>
                        <p>AccountRight Live gives you the option to store your data file on either your desktop or to upload the data file to AccountRight Live. In order for the simPRO Accounting link to work, you must upload the file to AccountRight Live.</p>
                        <p>The AccountRight Live link will not import employee cards.</p>
                        <p>The simPRO Accounting Link cannot transfer data when MYOB is in ‘Offline (check out)’ mode.</p>
                        <p>Customer and Supplier card files match the NAME field between MYOB and Enterprise. Therefore, if you manually create a customer in Enterprise named ‘Peter Lee’, as long as in MYOB it is called the exact same, accounting link will treat them as the same customer. Therefore, if there’s an invoice been created in Enterprise, it will be sent over against ‘Peter Lee’ in MYOB. If you change the name of the card file in simPRO, you can have change the name of that card file in MYOB as well. Otherwise, a new card file with new name will be created in MYOB.</p>
                        <h3>Xero</h3>
                        <p>Xero is true cloud software, so you don't have to install anything.</p>
                        <p>We cannot import employees or contact cards from Xero, only customer and site cards.</p>
                        <p>If you’ve recently migrated to Xero from another accounting package, the customers will be recorded as Contacts only until a transaction is recorded against them. Please contact our office and speak to Trainer on Call to get in touch.</p>
                        <h3>QuickBooks Online</h3>
                        <p>During the initial import, customers and suppliers can be imported from QuickBooks Online to simPRO.</p>

                    <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                        <p>To integrate with desktop accounting packages we require:</p>
                        <p>Administrator access to the PC where the accounting package is installed</p>
                        <p>Administrator access to your accounting system</p>
                        <p>Net framework 4.0 or above. This should be installed on the computer where your accounting software resides. If this is not currently the case please discuss with your IT professional. The simPRO trainer cannot perform this action as it may impact other systems.</p>
                        <h3>MYOB</h3>
                        <p>The Mac version of MYOB is not supported by the simPRO Accounting Link.</p>
