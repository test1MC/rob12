        <h1>simPRO to simPRO Job Dispatching</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>If one of your contractors is also using simPRO to manage their own business, you can create and dispatch a work order in simPRO that automatically creates a new job in the contractor's own simPRO build. Both parties will need to set this up in their simPRO builds using the steps below.</p>

                <p>If you are the contractor to receive dispatched jobs, follow this process. This must be done before the job creator can complete setup in their own simPRO build.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Check or adjust the job creator's customer card file in your simPRO build:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Under <strong>People &gt; Customers,</strong> create a customer card file for the job creator, or open their existing customer card file.</li>
                    <li>Go to the <strong>Settings </strong>sub-tab.</li>
                    <li>Ensure the customer has a <strong>Username </strong>and <strong>Password</strong>, or enter new ones. You will need to send the job creator these details.</li>
                    <li>Select the <strong>Allow customer to send jobs to your system </strong>check box.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Finally, send the job creator:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the username and password from their customer card file.</li>
                    <li>your own simPRO build address, such as brisbanelabour.simprosuite.com.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ensure the job creator then sets up dispatching in their own simPRO build.</p>

                <p>If you are the business dispatching jobs to a contractor, follow this process.</p>
                <p>First, ensure the contractor sets up dispatching in their own simPRO build.</p>
                <p>To complete this process you will need:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the contractor's simPRO build address, such as brisbanelabour.simprosuite.com.</li>
                    <li>the username and password the contractor entered in your customer card file in their simPRO build.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>Adjust the contractor's card file in your simPRO build:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Under <strong>People &gt; Contractors</strong>, create a contractor card file for the contractor, or open their existing contractor card file.</li>
                    <li>Go to the <strong>Settings </strong>sub-tab.</li>
                    <li>Under <strong>Contractor's simPRO</strong>, select the <strong>Allow jobs to be sent to contractor</strong> check box.</li>
                    <li>Enter the contractor's <strong>simPRO Address</strong>, and use the <strong>simPRO Username </strong>and <strong>simPRO Password </strong>you received from the contractor.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Dispatch a job to a contractor's simPRO</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>After completing setup, you can dispatch jobs to a contractor that will automatically create a new job in the contractor's simPRO build.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Screenshots/Jobs/dispatchcontractor.png" alt="A screenshot of a work order being dispatched to a contractor." class="border" />
                </p>
                <p>To dispatch a job directly to a contractor's simPRO build:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Schedule the job to the contractor, or create a new work order from the <strong>Contractor </strong>tab within the job.</li>
                    <li>Open the new work order through <strong>Jobs &gt; Contractor Jobs</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Dispatch </strong>at the top of the screen.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A dialogue box will appear to confirm the work order has successfully been dispatched.</p>
                <p>In the contractor's simPRO build, a new <strong>Pending </strong>job will automatically be created.</p>
