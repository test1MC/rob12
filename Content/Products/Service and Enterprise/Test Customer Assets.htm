        <h1>Test Customer Assets (Maintenance Planner only)</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>With Maintenance Planner, technicians can test customer assets on the job and record the results, which you can then see in simPRO. Test results can be recorded in a job card, or in Connect. If an asset fails a test you can immediately create a quote for fixing it.</p>

                <p>To record test results:</p>

                <h3>Record test results in Connect</h3>
