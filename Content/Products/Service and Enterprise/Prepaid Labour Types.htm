        <h1>Prepaid Labour Types</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>If you sell prepaid or up-front services to customers, you can use prepaid time in simPRO.</p>
        <p>To set this up, you will first need to create prepaid labour types and prepaid blocks, which you can use to sell prepaid time to a customer.</p>
        <p>If you have customers with multiple sites, and your customer needs to control which sites have access to prepaid time, you may wish to first enable customer and site based prepaid time.</p>
