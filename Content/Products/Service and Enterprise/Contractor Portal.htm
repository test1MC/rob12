        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Why use the contractor portal?</h3>
        <p>Enable contractors to use the contractor portal to increase your workflow efficiency, as contractors can enter information in the portal that you can then see in simPRO Enterprise, as well as view their job cards, invoices, and schedules. It also makes it easier for contractors to keep track of the work orders you have sent them.</p>
        <h3>What can contractors do through the portal?</h3>

        </p>
        <p>You can set up contractors with their own login details so they can view the work orders that you have issued them, as well as their invoices and schedules.</p>
        <p>Contractors can also mark pending jobs as complete once they have completed work, enter details on the actual works completed in the job card, as well as approve and reject any RCTIs you have created for them.</p>
        <p>Contractors can only see jobs, invoices and schedules relevant to them and their company in the contractor portal, and cannot edit, invoice, or archive jobs. The contractor portal also allows contractors to change specific profile details, profile details of other staff in their company, and add new individual staff members to their contractor company.</p>
        <p>All changes made and saved by contractors in the contractor portal will also be saved in Enterprise.</p>
        <h2>Enable access to the contractor portal</h2>
        <p>Any contractor in your system can access the contractor portal as long as they have a username and password. You do not need to select any licences or security groups.</p>
        <p>
