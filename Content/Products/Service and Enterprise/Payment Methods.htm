        <h1>Payment Methods</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Payment methods are the various ways in which your customers pay for the goods and services you provide, such as credit cards, cash, direct deposits, cheques, and even vouchers. A number of default payment methods are preset in simPRO and can be edited or deleted as required.</p>
        <p>When you define an <b>Account No.</b> for a payment method, this <b>Account No.</b> will fill in automatically each time a payment of this type is processed. The default deposit account number is set up in <strong>System &gt; Setup &gt; Defaults &gt; Financial</strong>.</p>
        <p class="Infotip">You may wish to define a separate cheque clearing account, or create a payment method to handle industry specific vouchers or finance payments.</p>

                </p>
                <p>To create a payment method:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to <strong>System &gt; Setup &gt; System Setup &gt; Accounts &gt; Payment Methods</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Create Payment Method</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Enter the payment method <strong>Name</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Select the payment method <strong>Type</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Enter the applicable <strong>Account No.</strong></li>
                    <li>Enter a finance charge if applicable.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Enter a finance charge</h3>
                <p>For each payment method you set up in simPRO, you can set a different finance charge as a percentage of the transaction. You can use this to pass onto your customers any additional charges associated with certain payment methods, such as bank fees for cheque deposits or credit card merchant fees.</p>
                <p>As this will appear on invoices, you can go to <strong>System &gt; Setup &gt; Defaults &gt; Financial &gt; Invoicing &gt; Finance Charge Label</strong> to give this charge a different name, such as 'convenience fee' or 'credit card surcharge'.</p>

                <p class="Infotip">When selecting a simPRO Payments method in Connect, users will see the <strong>Card Type</strong> rather than the associated payment method, while reports and invoices will show the full payment method, not just the card type.</p>
