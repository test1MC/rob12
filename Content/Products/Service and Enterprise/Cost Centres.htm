            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>When you create a new quote or job, you will need to select a cost centre. In Enterprise, quotes and jobs can have multiple cost centres, and parts and labour are added and schedules are created within each cost centre. This means that you can have two (or more) technicians performing different kinds of work at the same job site and you can easily keep track of their separate costs.</p>
                <p>You can also assign cost centres to <MadCap:xref href="Create a Lead.htm">Leads</MadCap:xref>.</p>
