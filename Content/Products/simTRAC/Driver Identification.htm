                <p>To assign drivers to vehicles manually:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Manage Vehicles</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Click the <strong>edit </strong>icon next to the desired vehicle.</li>
                    <li>Next to <strong>Driver</strong>, select the driver you would like to assign from the drop-down list. This list will only show drivers that have not already been assigned to a vehicle.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Update </strong>to save your changes.</li>
                </ol>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>You can assign a Radio-Frequency Identification tag to each driver. The driver will need to swipe their tag when they turn on their vehicle. simTRAC will recognise the tag and the driver associated with it and assign them to that vehicle until it is turned off. The driver's name will appear on the main map screen next to the vehicle's name. This is recommended if your drivers change vehicles regularly.</p>
                <p>To set up tags, you need to ensure that your GPS trackers are compatible. Contact our Support Team for more information.</p>
                <p>There are two components to our RFID tagging system: the RFID keyring tags and the in-car RFID readers. You must purchase these from simPRO Software directly. Once the readers have been installed into your vehicles, you will see your tags listed in <strong>Settings &gt; Manage Tags</strong>.</p>

                <p>To assign a tag to a driver:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Manage Drivers</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Click the edit icon next to the driver that you want to assign the tag to.</li>
                    <li>Next to <strong>Tag</strong>, select the tag number from the drop-down list. The tag number will be on the front of the RFID tag. Make sure you select the correct tag for the driver.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Update </strong>to save.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The tag will now appear next to the driver's name.</p>
