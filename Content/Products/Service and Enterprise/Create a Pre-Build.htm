        <h1>Create a Pre-Build</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Pre-builds combine materials and labour as a single billable item to appear on jobs, quotes and invoices. The two main types are standard price pre-builds and set price pre-builds, and you can adapt these as desired.  You can use pre-builds for many functions, including:</p>
        <ul>

                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/icon-enterprise-only-sm.png" class="enterpriseicon" title="This feature is only available in simPRO Enterprise" alt="Enterprise Only" /> Maintenance Planner</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.Enterprise">Maintenance Planner</li>
            <li>assemblies</li>
            <li>schedules of rates</li>
            <li>renewable energy</li>
            <li>contractors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pre-builds can also be a useful feature for your customers who use the customer portal. You can set up your portal so that if customers request a quote or book a job through the portal, they can select the work they need done from a list of pre-builds (such as 'Install double powerpoint').</p>
        <p>Before creating pre-builds you will need to <MadCap:xref href="Create a Pre-Build Group.htm">Create a Pre-Build Group</MadCap:xref>.</p>

                <p>Create a standard price pre-build if you want your pre-build's sell price to accurately reflect all costs involved, including materials, labour and associated markup.</p>
                <p>A pre-build's <strong>Pricing Type</strong> cannot be changed after the pre-build is first used.</p>

                </p>
                <p>To create a standard price pre-build:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to<strong> Materials &gt; Pre-Builds</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Create or open the group or subgroup you want your new pre-build to go in.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Create Pre-Build</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Enter the pre-build <strong>Name</strong>.</li>
                    <li>If required, enter a<strong> Part No.</strong> and select a <strong>Sales Tax Code</strong>. See below for important notes about pre-build tax codes.</li>
                    <li>Under <strong>Pricing Type</strong>, select<strong> Standard Price</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Under <strong>Material</strong>:<ol><li>Select whether the pre-build's <strong>Cost </strong>price is <strong>Based on Build</strong>, or manually enter the <strong>Cost</strong>.</li><li>Select whether the pre-build's <strong>Sell </strong>markup is <strong>Based on Defaults</strong>, <strong>Based on Build</strong>, or manually enter a percentage or <strong>Sell </strong>price.</li></ol></li>
                    <li>Under <strong>Labour</strong>:<ol><li>Select whether the pre-build's <strong>Time </strong>is <strong>Based on Defaults</strong>, or manually enter the <strong>Minutes</strong>.</li><li>Select whether the pre-build's <strong>Rates </strong>are <strong>Based on Defaults</strong>, or manually enter the labour rate information.</li></ol></li>
                    <li>If desired, enter <strong>Notes</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Click the <strong>Catalogue </strong>tab to continue.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Sales Tax Code</strong>: If you are working in countries with differing tax codes, such as the US, you may wish to select certain tax codes on your pre-build:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For materials-only pre-builds, select <strong>Use default part tax code</strong> or a specific materials tax code</li>
                    <li>For labour-only pre-builds, select <strong>Use default labour tax code</strong> or a specific labour tax code</li>
                    <li>If your pre-build has both materials and labour, select any tax code but ensure you check and update line item tax codes in each quote or job as required.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Notes about material and labour prices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the <strong>Material Cost</strong> is <strong>Based on Build</strong>, the<strong> Material Cost </strong>in the <strong>Break Down</strong> will be the total cost of items in the <strong>Build </strong>tab. This allows catalogue price updates to reflect in the pre-build.</li>
                    <li>If the <strong>Material Sell </strong>markup is <strong>Based on Build</strong>, pricing tiers will be applied to individual items in the <strong>Build </strong>tab to determine the pre-build's markup and sell value.</li>
                    <li>If the <strong>Material Sell</strong> price is <strong>Based on Defaults</strong>, the pre-build's material markup will be based on system defaults. If the pre-build is then used in a quote or job where the customer has a different material markup, that markup will reflect in the pre-build.</li>
                    <li>If the <strong>Labour Time</strong> is <strong>Based on Defaults</strong>, the pre-build's time will be a total of estimated fit time associated with the individual items added to the <strong>Build </strong>tab.</li>
                    <li>If the <strong>Labour Rates</strong> are <strong>Based on Defaults</strong>, the pre-build's labour will be charged according your system's default labour rates. If the pre-build is then used in a quote or job where the customer has different labour rates, those rates will reflect in the pre-build.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you need to edit a pre-build with history, it is recommended to make a copy of it first by clicking <strong>Options &gt; Copy Pre-Build</strong>, and edit the copy as needed. Alternatively, if you need to make a once-off change for a specific quote or job, add the pre-build to the quote or job then edit it from there.</p>

                <p>When you archive or delete a pre-build, it will still appear in any existing jobs or quotes that it has been added to, but will not be available to add to new jobs and quotes. If a catalogue item that has been included in a pre-build is deleted, it will be removed from the pre-build.</p>
