        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Phase 1">In simPRO, an invoice is a list of goods sent or services provided and the sum due for these from your customer. After you have <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/icon-enterprise-only-sm.png" class="enterpriseicon" title="This feature is only available in simPRO Enterprise" alt="Enterprise Only" /> approved, emailed, and received payment for an invoice, you can apply the payment to the invoice in simPRO.</p>

                <p>If you want to send a customer a progress claim for a job, but first want to obtain their approval before posting invoice details to your accounting package, you can create a request for claim.</p>
                <p>A request for claim is almost identical to a progress claim, but unlike a progress claim it does not post any information to your accounting package. This means you will not have to void a progress claim if your customer rejects your claim (providing only the percentage or value of the claim needs to change, and not the value of the project).</p>
                <p>If a customer approves your request for claim, you can then easily convert it to a deposit or progress claim for payment.</p>

It displays project information such as total contract value, claims to date, and the claim value remaining.

                <p>Raise progress claims to invoice for part of a job, such as when one stage of a project has been completed. When creating a claim, you can enter a percentage of the total value to claim, or manually enter a claim amount. Progress claims are numbered in order of issue, so the first claim you raise will be named <strong>Progress Claim #1</strong> and subsequent claims will be labelled as <strong>#2</strong>, <strong>#3 </strong>etc, while the final progress claim will be labelled as<strong> Final Claim</strong>. Progress claims may be associated with retentions.</p>
                <p>You can create a progress claim for a pending, progress or completed job and claim per item or enter the decided <strong>Claim Amount</strong> value as a percentage or an absolute figure. This amount can be claimed at section level or cost centre level. If you choose to claim by value, the <strong>Claim Per Item </strong>option will not be available for any subsequent progress claims for that job.</p>
                <p>There are several tools you can use in simPRO to assist in calculating your claim amounts so that you maintain positive cash flow:</p>

                        <p>Retention, also known as retainage in the United States, is the percentage of payment held from you by the customer to safeguard against defects in workmanship and ensure the job is completed to specific standards. Retention / retainage settings are usually defined at the beginning of a project to ensure amounts are calculated correctly for each progress claim.</p>
                        <p>After the project has been completed, all cost centres have been claimed, and the defined retention / retainage period, also known as a defects liability period, has passed, you will receive an alert in simPRO to claim the outstanding retention / retainage. You can then can create a retention / retainage claim to receive your defined final claim rebate.</p>
                        <p>To create a retention / retainage claim:</p>
                        <ol>

                            <li>Adjust the<strong> Date Issued</strong>, <strong>Payment Due</strong> terms and<strong> Invoice Comment</strong> as necessary.</li>
                            <li>View all retentions / retainages held or rebated in the <strong>Retentions </strong>/ <strong>Retainages Held</strong> table, then adjust the <strong>Retention </strong>/ <strong>Retainage Claimed</strong> amount as necessary.</li>

                <p>Raise progress claims to invoice for part of a job, such as when one stage of a project has been completed. When creating a claim, you can enter a percentage of the total value to claim, or manually enter a claim amount. Progress claims are numbered in order of issue, so the first claim you raise will be named <strong>Progress Claim #1</strong> and subsequent claims will be labelled as <strong>#2</strong>, <strong>#3 </strong>etc, while the final progress claim will be labelled as<strong> Final Claim</strong>. Progress claims may be associated with retentions.</p>
                <p>You can create a progress claim for a pending, progress or completed job and claim per item or enter the decided <strong>Claim Amount</strong> value as a percentage or an absolute figure. This amount can be claimed at section level or cost centre level. If you choose to claim by value, the <strong>Claim Per Item </strong>option will not be available for any subsequent progress claims for that job.</p>
                <p>There are several tools you can use in simPRO to assist in calculating your claim amounts so that you maintain positive cash flow:</p>
