        <h1>Stock Adjustments and Stocktakes</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Stock adjustments allow you to periodically correct stock levels without putting a burden on resources to perform a full stocktake. This is useful for technicians allocating stock in the field using Connect, as well as for improving your stock value reporting. For example, if your stock count accuracy is being negatively impacted by staff not following the correct stock management process, you can perform a stock adjustment on one or several items found to be incorrect, take note of negative or positive variations, and educate the applicable staff members about following the process correctly.</p>
        <p>Performing a stocktake at least once a year, or more frequently depending on the size of your inventory, is an important part of maintaining accurate stock reporting. Compared to stock adjustments, which are meant for corrections, a stocktake should be an end-to-end process and a total count of all physical stock in a storage device (location). This should be done prior to financial stock value reporting where practical.</p>
        <p>When performing stock adjustments or stocktakes, it is important that your catalogue pricing is up to date in order to accurately cost materials onto jobs. As there is no impact on inventory or accounts until a stocktake or adjustment has been finished and approved, it is also recommended to lock down the storage device that is being counted to prevent any transactions of inventory.</p>
