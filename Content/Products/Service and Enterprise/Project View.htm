                <p><strong>Project View </strong>displays multiple project jobs in a list, so that you can easily share your resources among several projects.</p>
                <p>Each project has two rows. The bottom row displays existing schedule blocks, and the top row is for creating new schedule blocks. Days that are shaded grey indicate that the resource is unavailable.</p>
