        <h1>Teams</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Teams are groups of employees, contractors, and plant items that can be scheduled as one unit. This is useful for avoiding scheduling conflicts and making your scheduling workflow more efficient.</p>
        <p>If any employee, contractor, or plant item in a team has already been scheduled to another job, the team as a whole will appear unavailable for scheduling, although the employees, contractors, and plant items will still be available individually. Individual employees, contractors, and plant items can be assigned to multiple teams.</p>
        <p>This feature is best used for teams that will be assembled for the long term, rather than teams that change regularly.</p>
        <p class="Infotip">You may wish to create a team for all employees so that you can easily schedule public holidays for everyone at once. You can also create a team for all technicians to schedule activities such as safety meetings.</p>
