        <h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
        <p>You can use Connect to view, create and update jobs, quotes and activities. You can also update schedules, manage purchase orders and, in simPRO Enterprise, tasks, and create invoices in the field.</p>
        <p>To log in to Connect to make use of these features, you need to <MadCap:xref href="#Get-licences">Get licences</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="#Enable-mobility">Enable mobility</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="#Download-connect">Download Connect</MadCap:xref>. You can then update your settings in simPRO when you <MadCap:xref href="Set Up Connect.htm" target="_blank">Set Up Connect</MadCap:xref> according to your business needs.</p>
        <h2><a name="Get-licences"></a>Get licences</h2>
        <p>To use simPRO Connect, you need to purchase a licence for each individual who will be using the app.</p>
        <p>To purchase licences for Connect or adjust the quantity of active licences, existing clients can go to <b>System</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>Subscriptions</b> (simPRO Service )&#160;/ <b>Licences</b> (simPRO Enterprise) in their simPRO system. New clients can contact simPRO through the <a href="https://simprogroup.com/" target="_blank">simPRO website</a>.</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Images/Connect - get user licences.png" alt="A screenshot of the licences page in simPRO, with add options to increase the number of licences." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Licences are a monthly recurring fee, and you can adjust the number of active licences each month. For example, you may wish to purchase additional licences for temporary staff during a busy period, and deactivate those licences when you no longer need them.</p>
        <p>As Connect is a separately licensed add-on product, your simPRO user licence does not give you access to Connect, nor does giving your field employees access to Connect require you to give them access to simPRO.</p>
        <h2><a name="Download-connect"></a>Download Connect</h2>
        <p>simPRO Connect is free to download from the App Store and Google Play for <MadCap:xref href="Connect Overview.htm#Compatible-devices" target="_blank">Compatible devices</MadCap:xref>. Simply access the relevant store online, and search for <b>simPRO Connec</b>t. You may need to sign in to the store and accept terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>We recommend that you allow automatic updates on your device, if available. This will ensure you are always running the most up-to-date version of Connect.</p>
        <h3><a name="Troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>If you experience any difficulty with downloading the app, or if you cannot see the app in the store:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check that your device and operating system are <MadCap:xref href="Connect Overview.htm#Compatible-devices" target="_blank">Compatible devices</MadCap:xref> for Connect.</li>
            <li>Update to a more recent version of iOS or Android, unless other app compatibilities prevent you from doing so. Even if your device is not listed as compatible with Connect, the app may work so long as you are using a supported operating system.</li>
            <li>Contact your device manufacturer or mobile service provider if you have trouble accessing your device store.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are using a compatible device and operating system but you are still experiencing difficulty, contact <a href="http://helpdesk.simpro.co/" target="_blank">simPRO Support</a> and provide the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The make and model of your device, e.g. iPhone 4s or Samsung Galaxy S3.</li>
            <li>The operating system and version, e.g. iOS 7.1 or Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean).</li>
            <li>The issue you are experiencing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Enable-mobility"></a>Enable mobility</h2>
        <p>To allow your employees and, in simPRO Enterprise, contractors to use Connect, you need to assign licences to their employee or contractor cards.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Images/Connect user access - mobility licence.png" alt="A screenshot of the mobility licence check box in the employee card in simPRO." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>To assign a mobility licence to an employee or contractor:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <b>People &gt; Employees</b> / <b>Contractors</b> and click the desired employee or contractor.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Profile &gt; Settings</b>.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Account Setup</b>, ensure that a <b><MadCap:xref href="#Username-and-password">Username and password</MadCap:xref></b> have been set.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Licences</b>, select <b>Mobility</b>.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Save</b> to update your changes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the <b>Mobility</b> check box is greyed out, this means all of your available licences are in use. You can remove a mobile licence from another employee / contractor and reassign it to another, or alternatively, you can purchase a new licence. To remove a licence, clear the <b>Mobility</b> check box in the desired employee's /  contractor's card, then click <b>Save</b>.</p>
        <h3><a name="Username-and-password"></a>Username and password</h3>
        <p>If you are creating a new employee or, in simPRO Enterprise, contractor, or granting access for the first time, a default username will be shown and the password will be blank. If the username you enter is already in use, a red cross will appear and you will not be able to save it. A green tick indicates a unique username.</p>
        <p>The username and password you give a user will apply to all areas of simPRO that you have given them access to, including as a general <b>User</b> of simPRO, the customer portal, and in simPRO Enterprise, <b>POS</b>, <b>Call Centre</b>, and as a <b>User</b> of  the Employee Portal.</p>
        <p>You can change the username and password at any time.</p>
        <h2><a name="Log-in-to-Connect"></a>Log in to Connect</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Images/Get Started With Connect - log in to Connect.png" alt="A screenshot of the Connect login screen, including the URL, username and password text boxes." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>When you have successfully downloaded the app, obtained and enabled user licences and set a username and password, you can log in to Connect to access the app's functionalities.</p>
        <p>To log in to Connect:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the app on your device.</li>
            <li>Enter your simPRO <b>URL</b>. This is the web address you use to access simPRO, for example, <i>yourcompany.simprosuite.com</i> or <i>yourcompany.simprocloud.com</i>.</li>
            <li>Enter your simPRO <b>Username</b> and <b>Password</b>.</li>
            <li>Tap <b>Login</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You will then be taken to the Connect dashboard. See <MadCap:xref href="Connect Tools.htm#Navigate-the-dashboard" target="_blank">Navigate the dashboard</MadCap:xref> for more information.</p>
        <p>You can also access Connect's <MadCap:xref href="Set Up Connect.htm#In-App-settings" target="_blank">In-app settings</MadCap:xref> before logging in by tapping <b>Settings</b> on the login page.</p>
        <p>To log out of Connect, tap the <b>logout</b> icon available in the top right in any page in Connect, then tap <b>Yes</b> to confirm. Connect will remember your simPRO URL and username on the device for your next login.</p>
