                <p>Tap <b>Start Travel</b> to update the mobile quote status to <b>Travelling</b>. This will activate geostamping of the status location if you have enabled it in your <MadCap:xref href="Set Up Connect.htm#Geostamping-settings" target="_blank">Geostamping settings</MadCap:xref>, as well as record the timestamp.
