        <h1>Copying Quotes and Jobs</h1>
        <h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
        <p>If you need to create a quote or job similar to an existing one in simPRO, save time by copying cost centre or section data to a new quote or job, by duplicating cost centres or sections within a quote or job, or by copying the entire quote or job.</p>

                <p>Reduce the need for manual data entry by copying cost centre or section data between quotes and jobs. This will copy settings including cost centre stage, billable and non-billable items, description, notes, and any discounts, fees and adjusted prices. Tasks, schedules, work orders, assigned stock, and purchase orders will not be copied.</p>
                <p>This information can be copied between service and project quotes jobs, although section names will not copy from project to service. If you copy cost centre data from a service quote or job to a project quote or job, a new section called <b>Copy</b> will be created in the project quote or job to contain the data. This feature is restricted by some security group settings; a user can copy from any quotes and jobs they can view, but can only paste to quotes and jobs they are able to edit.</p>
                <p>If a cost centre is locked when it is copied to another quote or job, it will also be locked on the other quote or job, and will need to be unlocked before changes can be made.</p>
                <p>If you copy a section, all its cost centres will be copied. However, only cost centres of the same type will be copied across. For example, if copying a section in the <b>Primary</b> sub-tab of a project quote, only <b>Primary</b> cost centres under that section will copy, and cost centres in the <b>Options</b> tab will need to be copied separately.</p>

                </p>
                <p>To copy cost centre or section data to another quote or job:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the quote or job.</li>
                    <li>Go to the <b>Cost Centre List</b> tab, or click <b>Cost Centres</b> at the top of the page.</li>
                    <li>On the section or cost centre you wish to copy, click <b>Options &gt; Copy To...</b></li>
                    <li>Search and select the quote or job you wish to copy to.</li>

                <p>If you copy an entire quote or job, its customer details, site details, estimated costs such as materials and labour, will be copied across to a new quote or job.  Tasks, schedules, work orders, assigned stock, and purchase orders will not be copied.</p>
