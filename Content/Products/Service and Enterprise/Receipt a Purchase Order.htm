        <h1>Receipt a Purchase Order</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>While a purchase order gives a committed cost to stock, quotes and jobs, receipting a purchase order will finalise the actual cost of those items. You can create receipts for purchase orders to suit your workflow, depending on whether you want to create a receipt after receiving goods, create a receipt after receiving goods and a site invoice, or create a receipt before receiving goods.</p>
        <p>Once you enter site invoice details into a receipt, simPRO will flag the invoice to be posted the next time you export to your accounting package. Ensure all item costs, freight, tax and totals match the site's invoice exactly.</p>
