        <h1>Job Activity Report</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Use the Job Activity report to examine overall job activity and transactions within the specified date range. Activity and transactions on jobs include creating jobs, purchase orders, scheduling, deposits and progress claims.</p>
        <p>This report may be used by project managers to determine how much to claim on progress claims, which will help to ensure cash flow is maintained for project jobs. It can also be used by service managers to examine jobs that have not been invoiced, and to assess overall resourcing against the volume of work.</p>
