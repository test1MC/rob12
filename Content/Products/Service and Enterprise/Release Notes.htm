                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/icon-enterprise-only-sm.png" class="enterpriseicon" title="This feature is only available in simPRO Enterprise" alt="Enterprise Only" /> A bug was including job variation sections in tax calculations even when the 'Include in retention calculations' check box was not selected. This meant you may have claimed tax on sections you didn't intend to. We have fixed this error and apologise for any inconvenience caused.</li>
            <li>After successfully posting transactions across to an integrated Xero accounting package, the transactions will now be correctly marked as flagged.</li>
            <li>As you can only create a system snapshot every four hours, we’ve fixed a bug that was counting deleting a snapshot as the creation of a new one.</li>
            <li>When posting invoices to an integrated QuickBooks Online accounting package, having an apostrophe in a customer’s name will no longer give you the “Customer cannot be found” error message. Phe’w!</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/icon-enterprise-only-sm.png" class="enterpriseicon" title="This feature is only available in simPRO Enterprise" alt="Enterprise Only" /> The Lead Status and Lead List reports won’t be returning simPRO errors any more.</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/icon-enterprise-only-sm.png" class="enterpriseicon" title="This feature is only available in simPRO Enterprise" alt="Enterprise Only" /> We’ve had a word with our Quote Detail Form Summary tables, so they’ll now show the right figures when using Primary and Options sections.</li>
