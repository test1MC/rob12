        <p>The simPRO team considers several factors when selecting features for future release updates, most importantly its value to the product, the user, and their business.</p>
        <p>Before you submit an idea, check the release notes and the product roadmaps for Enterprise &amp; Service, simTRAC, and Connect to see if your idea is already on its way.</p>
