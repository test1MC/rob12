        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>To convert a quote to a job, recurring job, or recurring invoice, click <b>Options &gt; Convert To &gt; Job / Recurring Job / Recurring Invoice &gt; OK</b>. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, access the desired quote, click <b>Finish</b>, then click <b>Convert To &gt; Job / Recurring Job / Recurring Invoice &gt; OK</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Images/Managing Existing Quotes - convert.png" title="Click Options, then hover over Convert To to view the different conversion options." alt="A screenshot of the quote conversion options from the Options drop-down list." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>If the quote has been approved, it will move to <b>Quotes &gt; Closed</b> and the job / recurring job / recurring invoice will be created. The cost centre will be locked according to settings in <b>System &gt; Setup &gt; Defaults &gt; System &gt; Jobs</b> and the <b>Next Due Date</b> for converted recurring jobs / invoices will be the same as the conversion date.</p>
        <p>You can then update the new job / recurring job / recurring invoice as desired. To access the original quote from within the converted job / recurring job, go to <b>Details &gt; Settings &gt; Options</b>, then click Open <b>Quote No</b>.</p>
        <p class="Infotip">If the job cost centre has been locked by items and price, any additional parts added to the job either in <b>Parts &amp; Labour</b> or from a receipted purchase order not created in the quote will be made non-billable, and you will not be able to add additional labour rates to the job.</p>
