        <h1>Minimum and Restock Levels</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Set minimum and restock levels to routinely maintain your inventory and increase efficiency in stock purchasing. When the quantity of a stock item has decreased to below its <strong>Minimum Level</strong> in a storage device, you will receive an alert to restock the item with either a purchase order or stock transfer so that it returns to its <strong>Restock Level</strong>.</p>
        <p>You may wish to set your restock level at the maximum quantity that you wish to keep of that item at any one time. This can also increase efficiency by purchasing required stock in bulk.</p>

                        <p>If a required stock item has a <strong>Minimum Pack Quantity</strong> specified in the item card file, that is, the minimum number of the item that can be purchased, this will affect the number of items ordered for restocking.</p>
                        <p>For example, you may have two items with a <strong>Minimum Level</strong> of eight and a <strong>Restock Level</strong> of 15. When you use two of each of these items on a job, their quantity will decrease to six and you receive an alert to restock the items. One of the items does not have a <strong>Minimum Pack Quantity</strong> specified, and therefore only needs to have nine items to return to its <strong>Restock Level</strong>.</p>
                        <p>The other item has a <strong>Minimum Pack Quantity</strong> of six, which means that it must be purchased in quantities of six when restocking. Therefore, you need to purchase 12 items instead of nine to both meet the<strong> Restock Level</strong> and comply with the <strong>Minimum Pack Quantity</strong>.</p>
