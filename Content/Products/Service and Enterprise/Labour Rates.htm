        <h1>Labour Rates</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Labour rates are used to estimate the charges of labour for quotes and jobs. You can create different labour rates for different levels of experience, such as senior technicians and apprentices.</p>
        <p>Then when you add labour to a quote, service job, or project job, you can view the <strong>Actual </strong>and <strong>Estimate Resources Cost</strong> in <strong>Details &gt; Summary</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you run your business on nett profit, you will need to calculate your overhead, cost rate and markup / sell rate before creating a labour rate. Please consult your financial advisor when calculating these values.</p>

                <p>In the labour rates table, the <strong>Including Overhead</strong> column displays which labour rates include overhead. The table also displays the <strong>Default </strong>labour rate, and which labour rates have been added to all customers in the <strong>Customer Template</strong> column.</p>

                <p>To set a default overhead:</p>

                    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="Infotip">Please ensure you consult your financial advisor before setting or adjusting the default overhead. You can adjust the default overhead at any time and this will update any quotes / jobs created in the future. For quotes / jobs that have already been created when the default overhead is changed, you will need to change the overhead manually on the quote / job as well.</p>
