        <h1>Setting up</h1>
        <h2>Get organised</h2>
        <h3>Cost Centres</h3>
        <p>Cost centres are key to simPRO. Essentially, you use cost centres to separate the different kinds of work your business provides so that you can see profit and loss in each cost centre you've specified.</p>
        <p>Once you've got your cost centres sorted, you can run reports to see how well you're doing in certain areas. One useful way to figure out what your cost centres should be is to look at what services you advertise to your customers. For example, you could have one cost centre for installation work and one cost centre for maintenance work.</p>
        <h3>Payment Methods</h3>
        <p>simPRO can process both credit card and other kinds of payments. Make a list of the payment methods you accept from customers. For credit card payments, you can set up simPRO Payments to accept payments over the phone or have technicians in the field accept payments using Connect.</p>
        <h3>Overhead</h3>
        <p>To run simPRO using gross profits, you'll need to have your overhead in the system. Your overhead includes costs for rent, utilities, marketing, accounting fees, insurance, internal staff wages, management wages and other costs that aren't related to work in the field.</p>
        <p>We have a special calculator to help you get your overhead costs sorted out. Just follow the instructions provided.</p>
        <h3>Labour Rates</h3>
        <p>Labour rates are how you charge your customers for labour. These aren't the same as employee hourly pay rates. For example, you might charge your customers more for work performed on weekends, so you would have one labour rate for standard work and another labour rate for weekend work.</p>
        <h3>Supplier Catalogues</h3>
        <p>Before you start creating quotes and jobs, get your supplier catalogues together so you can import them straight into simPRO. From there, you can easily add your parts to quotes and jobs and compare prices between suppliers. Follow our templates to format your catalogues correctly. We've also partnered with certain suppliers who can provide you with catalogues that are already formatted specifically for simPRO.</p>
