                <p>While it is possible to run eForms on a mobile phone device, we recommended using tablets. eForms also requires a device with a camera that supports auto-focus.</p>
                <p>simPRO eForms is designed to run on the following operating systems (OS):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apple iOS 7.0 and above</li>
                    <li>Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) and above</li>
                </ul>
                <p>simPRO eForms has been designed for and tested on the following tablets:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apple iPad Mini</li>
                    <li>Apple iPad with Retina display</li>
                    <li>Apple iPad Air</li>
                    <li>Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1</li>
                    <li>Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 LTE</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Other operating systems and tablets</h3>
                <p>Only the device versions specifically listed above have been confirmed to run simPRO eForms successfully, however other devices that have not been tested may also be compatible. Should you choose to run simPRO eForms on a different device, we recommend you test the app thoroughly before commencing actual work.</p>
                <p>If the device you are using runs simPRO eForms successfully and is not included in the compatible tablet list above, please let us know by contacting simPRO Support.</p>
                <p>It is not recommended to assume that newer or older versions of the same device or operating systems will also be compatible, as there may have been significant changes between releases. It is also not recommended to assume that a device or operating system that works with an earlier version of the eForms mobile app will work with a newer version.</p>
                <p>If the required operating system for simPRO eForms is not pre-installed on your device, it is recommended you check with your provider to see if it is available to download, as new OS versions can be delayed for quality assurance purposes.</p>
