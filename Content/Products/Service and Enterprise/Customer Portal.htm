        <h1>Customer Portal</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Why use the customer portal?</h3>
        <p>Through the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="NewGlossary.Term1">customer</MadCap:glossaryTerm> portal, you can provide your customers with the ability to view their own quotes, jobs and invoices; to pay invoices online; to view and edit their contact and site details; to book quotes and jobs online; and, if you are using Enterprise with <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="NewGlossary.Term19">Maintenance Planner</MadCap:glossaryTerm> purchased and enabled, to view detailed asset information and reports.</p>
        <p>You can set up your customer portal to give customers access to the information and functionality that best suits your business. For example, you may just want customers to just be able to view and pay their invoices online, or you may want them to have full access to view their quotes, jobs and invoices and be able to book a quote or job quickly and easily from within their own portal.</p>
        <p>When customers request a quote or book a job through their portal, the new quote or job will appear in your system and you will receive an alert. This saves you time manually obtaining quote and job information from customers and creating quotes and jobs in simPRO, and gives the customer greater control.</p>
        <p>Each customer will have their own unique login details. Once a customer has access to their portal, they can also create portal login details for as many of their own employees as they desire.</p>
        <p>Before using the customer portal we recommend ensuring your customer, quote, job, invoice and other information in simPRO is up to date, so the information customers see is correct.</p>
        <h3>What can customers do through the portal?</h3>
        <p>Depending on the options you enable, customers you set up to use the portal will be able to:</p>

                <p>Select <strong>Use Default Settings</strong> to use the system-wide email settings selected in <strong>System &gt; Setup &gt; Forms Setup &gt; General &gt; Email Setup</strong>, or adjust the read receipt and CC details as required.</p>
                <p>Adjust the default Email Template text as desired, and click options in from the Insert Field list to personalise your message as desired. Ensure the <strong>[customerPortalURL]</strong>, <strong>[customerUsername]</strong> and<strong> [customerPassword] </strong>fields remain in the template, to provide customers with the information they need to log in to the portal.</p>
                <p>It is recommended that you include a link to our <MadCap:xref href="Customer Portal Guide for Customers.htm">Customer Portal: Guide for Customers</MadCap:xref> in the email to provide your customers with instructions on how to use the customer portal. If necessary, you may wish to copy and paste only the sections that are applicable to your customer portal. For example, if you are a Service user you may want to exclude Enterprise-only features so that your customers don't get confused.</p>
                <h3>Test your customer portal</h3>
                <p>Before giving customers access to your customer portal, or after making changes to the portal settings, it is recommended to log in to your customer portal to test how it looks and works.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Screenshots/People/customerport-test.png" alt="A screenshot of the customer portal URL." class="border" />
                </p>
                <p>To test your customer portal:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a customer card file for testing purposes, or open an existing customer's card file.</li>
                    <li>Go to <strong>Profile &gt; Settings</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Enter or check the <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong>. Make a note of these.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Click the <strong>Log out</strong> button in the top right of the screen to log out of simPRO.</li>
                    <li>In the browser's address bar at the top of the screen, in your build address (such as yourbuild.simprosuite.com) change /staff to /customer and delete any text to the right. See screenshot above for reference.</li>
                    <li>Press <strong>Enter</strong> on your keyboard.</li>
                    <li>This is the screen your customers will see when they log in. Enter the <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> you saved on the customer card file in step 3.</li>
                    <li>Click<strong> Login</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Screenshots/People/customerport-pending.png" alt="A screenshot of the Pending tab in the customer portal." class="border" />
                </p>
                <p>This is your customer portal. While it looks very similar to your regular simPRO build, you will notice several key differences, such as the <strong>Request a Quote</strong> and<strong> Book a Job</strong> buttons in the top right corner (if selected in <strong>Enabled Pages</strong>)</p>
                <p>Test various functions of the portal to see how your customers will view information and the features available to them. You may also wish to work through the <MadCap:xref href="Customer Portal Guide for Customers.htm">Customer Portal: Guide for Customers</MadCap:xref> to understand the steps a customer will follow to use the system.</p>
                <p>To return to your simPRO build, log out of the build and change the URL in your browser's address bar from <strong>/customer </strong>to <strong>/staff</strong> again.</p>
