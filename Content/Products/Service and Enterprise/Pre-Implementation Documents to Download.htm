        <h1>Pre-Implementation Documents to Download</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Before we begin implementing simPRO Enterprise into your business, you need to download, view, and complete several documents to ensure your implementation goes as smoothly and quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>For detailed information about what you need to prepare in your accounting package, please consult our article about Accounting Requirements.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to call our administration team using the number(s) provided in your welcome pack.</p>

                <h3>Employee Training Planner</h3>
                <p><strong>Download and complete: </strong><a href="../../Resources/Downloadable/Employee_TrainingPlanner.pdf">Employee Training Planner</a>
                </p>
                <p>In the planner, you can specify which of your employees will be completing the training, whether any employees have any knowledge or experience with simPRO Enterprise, and of course, the areas of simPRO they need to be trained in.</p>
                <p>This is useful for scheduling your employees for training, as well as for your trainer to plan each module.</p>
                <p>If you require training in more than one location, you need to complete a form for each additional location and specify whether any training material needs to be repeated for the different location(s). This is useful for determining how much training you require for each location.</p>
                <h3>Enterprise Implementation and Training Guide</h3>
                <p><strong>Download and view: </strong><a href="../../Resources/Downloadable/IM - Enterprise Implementation &amp; Training Guide - D.pdf">Enterprise Implementation and Training Guide</a>
                </p>
                <p>You can use this guide to ensure you are aware of what you will be training in, who needs to be there to train, and what you need to prepare before each training module.</p>
                <p>This is useful for scheduling and preparing for your training, as well as for determining whether you will need additional training days for certain simPRO Enterprise features. Once you have viewed the guide and completed these tasks, your training will be significantly more efficient.</p>
                <h3>Overhead On-Cost Calculator</h3>
                <p><strong>Download and complete:</strong> <a href="../../Resources/Downloadable/Overhead Oncost Calculator.xlsx">Overhead On-Cost Calculator</a></p>
                <p>It is important that your overhead figure is accurate so that you can track your profit and loss in simPRO. You should calculate this regularly to keep figures up-to-date.</p>
                <p>To calculate your overhead and employment costs, follow the instructions provided and enter your relevant company information.</p>
                <h3>Supplier Catalogues</h3>
                <p><strong>Download and complete:</strong> <a href="../../Resources/Downloadable/Catalogue Import Template AU.csv">Catalogue Import Template</a></p>
                <p>You can obtain and import supplier price lists specifically formatted for your simPRO system. To obtain a simPRO-formatted supplier price file, you can contact the branch manager or IT department of the head office of several wholesalers in Australia.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, you can download and complete the <strong>Catalogue Import Template</strong> to create and import supplier price files in a generic format.</p>
                <p>To enter the accurate catalogue item information and pricing, you can obtain a quote from your supplier for the most commonly used items over approximately the past six months, or alternatively, consult your invoices over approximately the past three months. When manually entering items, ensure that the cost price is accurate, up-to-date, and not a discounted version from a special project to prevent generating underestimated quotes.</p>
                <p>You can also convert a PDF catalogue created in tables to a Microsoft Excel file. This method may require a lot of work and may not be sufficient.</p>
                <p>Once the files are prepared, the trainer will guide you through importing the price files. When formatted correctly, the import process is brief.</p>
                <p class="Infotip">Suppliers may issue a Microsoft Excel file containing their price list that is not in a compatible format. It is your responsibility to reformat these incompatible files before importing.</p>
