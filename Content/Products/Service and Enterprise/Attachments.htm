        <h1>Attachments</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In simPRO, attachments can be added many areas, including quotes, jobs, items and people. You may wish to use attachments to easily store copies of agreements or contracts, images of items, and other associated documents.</p>
        <p>Attachments are managed through the <strong>Attachments </strong>tab in a quote, job, customer card file etc. This tab does not appear until the project has been saved at least once.</p>
        <p>Access to creating, editing and deleting attachments and attachment folders may be restricted by a user's security group settings.</p>
        <p>Changes to attachments will update in Connect after syncing. Read more on using and renaming attachments in Connect.</p>
