        <h1>Invoice Payments</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>When customers make payments on invoices you have issued them for jobs, you can apply payments to their invoices in simPRO depending on your security group settings. If you have activated <MadCap:xref href="simPRO Payments.htm">simPRO Payments</MadCap:xref>, you can also apply payments made by credit card over the phone.</p>
        <p>You can begin the process of applying a payment to an invoice in a number of ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>By invoice: Go to <strong>Invoices &gt; Unpaid Invoices</strong>, find the desired invoice, right-click it or click <strong>Options</strong>, and click <strong>Apply Payment</strong>.</li>
            <li>By customer: Go to<strong> Invoices &gt; Unpaid Invoices</strong>, search for the customer, select the desired invoices, and click <strong>Apply Payment </strong>at the bottom of the table.</li>
            <li>By customer statement: Go to <strong>People &gt; Customers</strong>, find the customer, and right-click it or click <strong>Options &gt; View &gt; Statement</strong>. Select invoices to pay then click <strong>Pay Invoices </strong>at the bottom of the table.</li>
            <li>By invoiced job: Go to <strong>Jobs &gt; Invoiced Jobs</strong>, find the desired invoiced job, click the <strong>...</strong> button to expand it, find the desired invoice in the <strong>Unpaid Invoice</strong> list, then right-click it or click <strong>Options</strong>, and click <strong>Apply Payment</strong>.</li>
            <li>Within an invoice: Open an invoice, click the <strong>Payments </strong>tab, and click<strong> Add Payment</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="WarningTip">Once a payment has been applied to an invoice, it is not recommended to edit it or delete the payment, as it may have already posted to your accounting package.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot> Save customer banking details</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>If your customers frequently pay by cheque, save time by setting up their payment details in their customer card file, removing the need for repeated entry of their information. Open their card file, go to <strong>Profile &gt; Settings</strong>, and fill out their <strong>Banking </strong>information. The next time you process a cheque from that customer, all you will need to manually enter is their cheque number.</p>
