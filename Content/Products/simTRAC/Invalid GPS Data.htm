        <h1>Invalid GPS Data</h1>
        <p>Invalid GPS data is when simTRAC is not receiving a sufficient GPS signal from the tracker in a vehicle.</p>

        </p>
        <p>An <strong>orange exclamation</strong> icon next to your vehicle indicates a poor GPS signal. Possible causes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The vehicle is parked in garage or underground car park. If the vehicle has GSM coverage it will still give the ignition status for when the vehicle was turned on and off.</li>
            <li>The GPS antenna has been installed in an incorrect place.</li>
            <li>The tracker has been tampered with.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will still receive updates from a tracker while the GPS location is invalid. Hover over the <strong>orange exclamation</strong> icon to view the number of updates.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The icon will disappear once GPS signal improves.</p>
